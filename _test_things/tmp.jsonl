{"prompt_type": "Factual Question", "system_prompt": "You are an expert in generating factual questions.", "user_prompt": "Factual questions are questions that have a single, accurate answer. Based on the outline provided, please generate factual questions. Follow the steps and requirements below:\n1. Filter the key-value pairs from the outline that can form factual questions.\n2. Directly generate or summarize the key-value pairs for factual questions: If the value type belongs to names, numbers, locations, entities, financial indicators, nouns, or noun phrases, keep it unchanged. Otherwise, summarize the value to generate key-value pairs. If the summarized value is still a sentence, discard this key-value pair.\n3. Generate factual questions and corresponding answers based on the key-value pairs. Ensure that the questions are clear and have a single standard answer. Try to vary the types of questions, avoiding multiple questions of the same answer type. The types of answers include names, numbers, locations, entities, financial indicators, nouns, or noun phrases.\n\nBelow are some sample questions and answers to guide you on how to format the generated factual questions and answers:\n\nSample Questions:\n[\n    {{\n        \"question type\": \"Factual Question\",\n        \"question\": \"Where is Apple Inc. registered?\",\n        \"answer\": \"New York.\"\n    }},\n    {{\n        \"question type\": \"Factual Question\",\n        \"question\": \"Which company did Apple Inc. acquire in a recent acquisition?\",\n        \"answer\": \"Google Inc.\"\n    }},\n    {{\n        \"question type\": \"Factual Question\",\n        \"question\": \"What was the total revenue of Apple Inc. in 2023?\",\n        \"answer\": \"150 million USD.\"\n    }},\n    {{\n        \"question type\": \"Factual Question\",\n        \"question\": \"What clause did Apple Inc. amend during the shareholder meeting?\",\n        \"answer\": \"The restrictive clause in the company's charter.\"\n    }}\n]\n\nRejected Questions and Answers:\n[\n    {{\n        \"question type\": \"Factual Question\",\n        \"question\": \"What event happened to Apple Inc. in July 2021?\",\n        \"answer\": \"Bankruptcy reorganization\",\n        \"Reason\": \"There might be multiple events that happened to Apple Inc. in July 2021, so avoid ambiguity.\"\n    }},\n    {{        \n        \"question type\": \"Factual Question\",\n        \"question\": \"What green product did Apple Inc. develop in 2021?\",\n        \"answer\": \"Green product\",\n        \"Reason\": \"The answer repeats the question without actually answering it, making it an invalid question. Do not generate such questions.\"\n    }}\n]\n\nPlease follow the structure of the above examples to construct factual questions, including the question type, question content, and answers, based on the provided outline.
