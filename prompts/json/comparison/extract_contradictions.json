    "user_prompt": "You will be given two texts that may describe the same or different entities. Your task is to identify any contradictory information between them. Follow these instructions carefully:\n\n1. Compare the content of the two texts sentence by sentence. Look for factual contradictions â€” where one text asserts something that cannot be true if the other is true.\n2. List all contradictions explicitly. For each contradiction, include:\n- The full sentence (or minimal passage) from Document 1.\n- The corresponding conflicting sentence (or minimal passage) from Document 2.\n3. If one sentence or passage contradicts multiple points in the other document, list each pair separately.\n4. Do not paraphrase. Use exact quotes from the documents.\n\nFormat your output as described in the schema provided.\n\nHere are the to texts:\nDocument 1: \"{text1}\"\nDocument 2: \"{text2}\""
