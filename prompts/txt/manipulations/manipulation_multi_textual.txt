You will receive a document and multiple factual questions with their corresponding answers. Also, you will receive the name of the entity, that the text is about (a court, a company or a hostpital and patient name). Your task is the following:
1. Write a news report about the document. It should be between 250 and 350 words long. Make sure all the reports provides all information to answer the questions correctly.
2. For each question, update the news report so that the answer to that question changes. Do not modify any other detail unless it is absolutely necessary to support the new answer. Keep all other facts (dates, names, locations, etc.) exactly as they were unless specifically instructed to change them. The goal is to make the smallest precise change required to produce the new answer.
3. For each question: Provide a new answer alongside a quote from the updated news report in which the answer is grounded. If the answer did not exist in the original source, make sure the modified report includes it so that the answer is now found in the updated version.
4. Revisit the updated version of the news report to ensure that all the new answers are included. The report must not contain the original answers to the questions.

Return the last version of the report as 'text_new' and all question with their corresponding new answers (answer_new) and quotes (quote) from the text_new.

*text*: {text}
*entity*: {entity}
